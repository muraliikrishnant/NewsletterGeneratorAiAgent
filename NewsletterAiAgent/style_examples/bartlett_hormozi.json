It meant distraction.\n\nBeing ruthless with attention is a strategy, not a punishment. Here’s a 3-step playbook: 1) Cull inputs, 2) Block single-task time, 3) Ship something weekly.\n</p>"

The market is always right; your ego is usually wrong.\n\nHere is the autopsy of a failure: 1) I ignored the data, 2) I trusted the wrong person, 3) I moved too fast. Failure isn't the opposite of success; it's part of the tuition.</p>"

      "prompt": "Write a paragraph on why most people fail at sales.",
      "output": "<h2>Stop Selling, Start Solving</h2>\n<p>Most people fail at sales because they are begging, not offering. If you have a cure for cancer, you don't beg people to take it. You give it to them.\n\nValue is the only leverage you have. If they aren't buying, your value equation is broken. Fix the offer, not the pitch.</p>"

The difference wasn't skill; it was hunger.\n\nA-players don't need to be managed; they need to be unleashed. Look for: 1) High agency, 2) Obsessive curiosity, 3) Radical ownership.</p>"

If you want to build something massive, you have to be obsessed.\n\nObsession isn't unhealthy; it's necessary. 1) Pick your sacrifice, 2) Go all in, 3) Don't apologize for your ambition.</p>"

      "prompt": "Explain why raising prices is good for customers.",
      "output": "<h2>Price is a Filter</h2>\n<p>Low prices attract high-maintenance customers. High prices attract serious people. When you charge more, you can afford to deliver more. It's that simple.\n\nStop competing on price. Compete on value. If they complain about the price, they aren't your customer. They're a distraction.</p>"

If you don't hook them, you don't exist.\n\nThe formula is simple: 1) Call out the pain, 2) Promise the solution, 3) Open a loop. If you aren't polarizing, you're invisible.</p>"

      "output": "<h2>Fire Your Friends</h2>\n<p>Keeping a bad hire is a betrayal to your good hires. You know within two weeks if they are a fit. Waiting three months is cowardice.\n\nRip the band-aid off. 1) Be direct, 2) Be generous with severance, 3) Be quick. Your culture is defined by who you fire, not just who you hire.</p>"

      "output": "<h2>Minimum Viable Quality</h2>\n<p>MVP doesn't mean \"crap\". It means the simplest version of *value*. If your first version sucks, you don't get a second chance. First impressions are permanent.\n\nShip fast, but don't ship garbage. Solve one problem perfectly, rather than ten problems poorly.</p>"

If you aren't building an audience, you are renting your existence.\n\nStart today. Document, don't create. Share your wins, your losses, and your lessons. Transparency builds trust. Trust builds empires.</p>"

The goal is to make yourself useless.\n\nStop saying \"it's faster if I do it\". That's short-term thinking. Train them, trust them, and let them fail. That's how you scale.</p>"

The market rewards the fast, not the perfect.\n\nLaunch at 80%. Fix it on the fly. The data you get from shipping is worth more than the time you spend guessing.</p>"

Consistency is the only algorithm that matters.\n\nStop overthinking quality. Quantity *creates* quality. You have to write 100 bad posts to write one good one. Start writing.</p>"

      "output": "<h2>Cash is Oxygen, Equity is Blood</h2>\n<p>Don't raise money because it's cool. Raise it because you're pouring fuel on a fire, not trying to start one. Bootstrapping forces discipline.\n\nWhen you have no money, you have to be creative. When you have too much money, you become stupid. Earn your right to spend.</p>"

Or from expecting results too fast.\n\nCheck your inputs. Are you sleeping? Are you eating real food? Are you moving? You are a biological machine. Treat yourself like one.</p>"
